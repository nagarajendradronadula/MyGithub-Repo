        <h3>Meet Lucy</h3>
        <p>
            Lucy, the goldfish, enjoys exploring her tank, navigating through plants and rocks. She interacts with fish-safe toys, pushing a ball or swimming through hoops. Socializing with tank mates is part of her routine, as goldfish are sociable creatures. Feeding time excites Lucy, as it's the highlight of her day. She also values her downtime, often seen floating calmly in the water or resting near a plant. Observing Lucy's preferences is key to understanding her unique personality. Despite being a goldfish, Lucy's activities reflect her vibrant spirit, teaching us that even the simplest creatures have their own joys in life.
